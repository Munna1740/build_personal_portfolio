            <h2>Big Dream</h2>
            <h3>Become a modern MakeUp Artist</h3>
            <p>Makeup is a career unlike any other. For over 20 years (I started when I was 6…I hope you believe that!) it has taken me around the globe and given me experiences that I still find unreal. It’s a career that has allowed me to live a dream. When it comes to what I love about being a makeup artist, the list is too long to measure.In working with so many people, and hearing about their insecurities, I have been able to reflect on my own. Taking the time to do so has made me a better and kinder man.</p>
